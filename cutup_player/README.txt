Heavy Rotation (Cut-up Instrument No. 1)
2013-08-10

This audio for this piece comes from 5 banks containing tens of thousands of prepared sound fragments.  The program cycles continuously through the available fragments, choosing the next one randomly as the previous one finishes playing.

You can "play" the piece by waving your hand, flashing a light object, or making other motions (gradual motions work best) that will cause the attached webcam to detect an object in the frame.  The size of the detected object (relative to the whole frame) is used to narrow down the pool of fragments that will be chosen from to play.  The smaller the detected object, and the more it stays in the same position, the more likely you are to hear the same audio fragments repeated.

The spacebar toggles between pause and play.  The "c" key toggles webcam object detection on and off.

This program was made using Processing, and uses libraries and sample code from other open source projects, including:
 * OpenCV http://opencv.org/
 * JavaCVPro http://www.mon-club-elec.fr/pmwiki_reference_lib_javacvPro/pmwiki.php?n=Main.HomePage
 * GSVideo http://gsvideo.sourceforge.net/
